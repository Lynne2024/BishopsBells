<p>Bishops Bells is a team of fifteen ringers who rehearse weekly, on a Tuesday evening, at <a href="https://www.stpetersbw.org.uk/">St Peter's Church</a> in Bishops Waltham.  We are a very friendly group and always keen to welcome new ringers.</p>

<p>We regularly perform at the Womens' Institute, social groups for the elderly and the disabled, childrens' groups and church groups. These performances include a talk on the history of Bishops Bells and handbell ringing, a demonstration of handbell ringing by six or more members of the team, and the opportunity for the audience to have a go.   </p>

<p>The whole team performs at the Christmas services at St Peter's Church, and occasionally takes part in other concerts</p>

<p>This year, 2024, is a very special year for Bishops Bells as we are celebrating our 40th birthday. We held a rally in June, where we invited local handbell teams to come and spend the day playing with us - and eating cake!  On 23 November, we are holding a 40th birthday concert with <a href="https://www.flautissimo.com/">Flautissimo: The Southampton Flute Orchestras</a>, who are also celebrating their 40th birthday.  Please see the details at the top of this page for more information.
