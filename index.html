<p>Bishops Bells is a team of fifteen ringers who meet weekly, on a Tuesday evening, at St Peter's Church in Bishops Waltham to practise ringing tunes on the handbells and prepare for performances.  We are a very friendly group and always keen to welcome new ringers.</p>

<p>We regularly perform to groups such as the Womens' Institute, social groups, childrens' groups and church groups. These performances include a talk on the history of Bishops Bells and handbell ringing, a demonstration of handbell ringing by six or more members of the team, and the opportunity for the audience to have a go.   </p>

<p>The whole team regularly performs at St Peters' church advent and Christmas services, and occasionally takes part in other concerts</p>

<p>This year, 2024, is a very special year for Bishops Bells as we are celebrating our 40th birthday. We held a rally in June, where we invited local handbell teams to come and spend the day playing with us - and eating cake!  On 23 November, we are holding a 40th birthday concert with Flautissimo: The Southampton Flute Orchestras, who are also celebrating their 40th birthday.  Please see the details at the top of this page for more information.
